# dataMULE
Currently working on building a Web Application using python(flask, np, pandas), sql(sqlachemy), html, css, and js in order to create a platform where data from athletes can be collected, stores, and studied with the intention to be able to make more data oriented decisions. In this first iteration of the project we will be collecting the data collected by the Hawking Dynamics pressure plates and gathering the information through the API.
